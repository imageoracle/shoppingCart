# shoppingCart

Shopping cART is a game you play in real life and on the underground internet.  
The game is darkly humorous and a naughtier version of punch buggy mixed with bum fight.  It is totally wrong and totally right.
First Rule: Abandoned shopping carts are Currency.  See one in real life?  Add your photo to the game and claim your points when another person spots your cart.
Encampments are Jackpots.  Road Kill, yard sale signs, and yard sales are worth points.  Sometimes a cart will have things in it like radio equipment or shit coins.  
Points for Ditching the cops and figuring out whose the narc.  Winos, zombies, and copper hunting.  
Currency in shopping carts in Haven can be filled with wallet donations, to set up shared rides, food giveaways, power charging stations, public water works.
